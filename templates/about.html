<h4 class="post-title">About</h4>
Thanks for checking out my page! My name's John and I'm currently an undergraduate student currently studying Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley. Outside of classes, I'm a huge Lakers fan and Star Wars nerd. I'm also a consultant with UC Berkeley's <a href="https://vcg.berkeley.edu">Valley Consulting Group</a>, a student run organization that collaborates with big tech names on a wide variety of projects. Last but not least, I'm a research assistant with <a href="http://bets.cs.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley's BETS</a> laboratory. I assist graduate students with research that rethinks the scale and efficiency of tools for solving today's building, energy, and transportation challenges.

In the past couple summers, I've had the fortune of working with some wonderful individuals at <a href="http://makeschool.com">Make School (YC W12)</a> as an iOS Games Instructor and at Apple ï£¿ under the AppleCare iOS division as a Software Engineering Intern. At Make School, I taught seventy-five students the fundamentals of iOS development and guide five special students to succesfully shipping their own gaming applications to the App Store! At Apple, I developed software tools for interfacing with and diagnosing potential hardware issues with the iOS product line, specifically the iPhone.

This coming summer 2018, I'll be heading over to Mountain View to intern at Google. I'll be working on Google Assistant, specifically their iOS platform! Hopefully a couple months down the road, I'll be able to talk about what exactly that means in more detail. I'm interested in the general realms of machine learning and embedded systems. Specifically, I enjoy projects that discuss how we can make the physical world around us smarter. As you can probably guess, I also very much enjoy iOS and web development, too!
