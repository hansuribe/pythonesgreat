Tutorials:
- Add Social Share Buttons: https://simplesharebuttons.com/html-share-buttons/

Details:
- When editing webpages, after editing html and css pages, the html edits will show up, but the css edits will not appear. This is b/c these websites cache those files instead of reloading them. To see css edits, perform a hard reload to bypass the cache

Next Steps:
- Add Disque Discussion Page
- Make bottom buttons coverable
- Edit share blog to be responsive + correct links
- Edit blog list design
